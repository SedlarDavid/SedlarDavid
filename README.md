## Hi, I am David

Right now i am working as .NET Developer in company CNGroup.dk. But it's not all i can do!
In the past few years i was *Head of Mobile Development* in worldee.com, where we have built the best travel app entirely in Flutter.

So my two main focuses are Mobile Development and Backend Development.

In **Mobile Development** i can do things such as:
- Flutter
- Android native in Kotlin, prefferably JetpackCompose
- iOS Basics

and in **Backend Development** i can:
- do .NET backend 
- do PHP backend, mainly in Laravel

In case you need some **Frontend** i have some knowledge in:
- React
- Svelte

So basically i am fullstack dev right now.
And yep, i can take a lead for some teams.

I am very interested in interesting projects with great ideas so feel free to contact me for cooperation.
