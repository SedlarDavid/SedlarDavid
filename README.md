## Hi, I am David

Right now i am working as .NET Developer in company [CNGroup.dk](https://cngroup.dk). But it's not all i can do!
In the past few years i was *Head of Mobile Development* in [worldee.com](https://worldee.com), where we have built the best travel app entirely in Flutter.

So my two main focuses are Mobile Development and Backend Development.

In **Mobile Development** i can do things such as:
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)
- [Android](https://developer.android.com/) native in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), prefferably [JetpackCompose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
- [iOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15/) Basics

and in **Backend Development** i can:
- do [.NET backend](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) 
- do PHP backend, mainly in [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)

In case you need some **Frontend** i have some knowledge in:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)

So basically i am fullstack dev right now.
And yep, i can take a lead for some teams.

I am very interested in interesting projects with great ideas so feel free to contact me for cooperation.
